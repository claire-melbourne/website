## About

Supported services: `fargate`, `static`.

The Maintenance Mode allows you to temporarily divert traffic from your service to a page that informs your users that the service is temporarily unavailable.
The page your users will see looks like this:

<div className="drop-shadow-md rounded min-h-[200px]">

<Image
  className="margin-0 rounded"
  height="200"

/>
</div>

## How to enable it

Go to the Environment where the services are located and click on the "Maintenance Mode" option within the Environment menu options.

You'll be prompted with a confirmation modal and once you confirm it, we'll start the process of enabling the mode for all the supported service within that Environment.

Once the process has finished the services that have been set to Maintenance Mode will look like this:

/>

## How to disable it

To disable it and go back to the regular setup, you'll see the option in the same place where you enabled it, but this time you will not need to confirm.
As soon as you click on the button, we'll revert the services back to the original configuration.

## How it works

This feature leverages the Cloudfront layer that is used by the supported services. We temporarily add an extra cache behavior to the existing Cloudfront Distribution, and we configure it to use a Lambda@Edge that in turn serve the page shown above.
